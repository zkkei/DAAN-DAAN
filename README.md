DAAN DAANOptimizing Metro Manila Traffic with the Braess' ParadoxDAAN DAAN is a graph-based simulation model that identifies strategic road closures to reduce, rather than worsen, overall network travel time in Metro Manila.The Problem: ₱3.5 Billion Daily LossMetro Manila's traffic congestion results in an estimated economic loss of ₱3.5 billion per day. Traditional solutions, like building more roads, often fail to provide long-term relief and can sometimes exacerbate the problem. This project introduces a counter-intuitive but scientifically-backed approach derived from the Braess' Paradox: sometimes, less is more.The Solution: A Proactive, Data-Driven ModelDAAN DAAN leverages the Braess' Paradox by systematically simulating the impact of closing individual road segments within a given traffic network. It's a proactive, automated tool designed to provide actionable insights for urban planners and local government units (LGUs).How It WorksThe model follows a three-step process:Input: It takes user-defined parameters (location, trip samples, congestion severity) and geospatial data from OpenStreetMap.Process: Using Python with OSMnx and NetworkX, it builds a road network graph. It then runs iterative simulations, closing one road segment at a time, re-routing traffic, and calculating the net change in total system travel time.Output: The system generates a ranked list of the most beneficial road closures, quantifying the time saved and providing a "Winners vs. Losers" analysis to understand the distributive impact.Key Findings & ResultsThe model was tested on two distinct, high-traffic urban networks: Alabang and Port Area, Manila.Alabang: The optimal road closure (Ilaya Street) resulted in a total system travel time saving of 1,343.90 minutes across 5,000 simulated trips.Port Area: The best-performing closure saved 36.94 minutes in system-wide travel time.In both cases, a paired sample t-test confirmed that the reductions in travel time were statistically significant ($p < .001$).Why DAAN DAAN?ToolApproachDescriptionWaze / Google Maps<span style="color:#D97706">REACTIVE</span>Responds to existing traffic conditions in real-time but doesn't address the root cause of congestion.DAAN DAAN<span style="color:#10B981">PROACTIVE & AUTOMATED</span>Identifies systemic improvements before they are implemented.
